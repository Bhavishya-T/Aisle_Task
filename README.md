# Aisle_Task

To clone the repo, simply run "$git clone <repository URL>" in your CLI

To start with the application, enter **./gradlew assembleDebug** in CLI. This will build your apk inside gradle like this **app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk**
You can then use this apk to run on emulator or device of your choice.

This application has - 
- Screen 1, which is the login with phone number screen. 
- Screen 2, which is login with otp. You can also go back to the original screen by clicking on edit button or you can continue after entering OTP. The timer will eventually run out forcing you to go back to screen 1 just in case
- Screen 3, which is the notes screen. Here testing data with reference to API data has been used and mentioned in the code.
